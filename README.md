# Object Detection Project

## Overview
This project focuses on the study and implementation of various object detection techniques. It covers a wide range of objects including faces, vehicles, and more. Different methods are employed to achieve accurate and efficient detection.

## Techniques Used
The following object detection techniques have been explored in this project:

### 1. Face Detection
- Description: Face detection is a crucial component in many applications. This technique involves locating and identifying human faces within an image or video stream.
- Implementation: [Link to Face Detection Code](./face_detection.py)

### 2. vehicle Detection
- Description: vehicle detection is essential in scenarios like autonomous driving and traffic monitoring. This technique aims to identify and locate vehicles in images or video frames.
- Implementation: 
    ## Techniques Used
    The following vehicle detection techniques have been explored in this project:

    ### 1. YOLO (You Only Look Once)
    - Description: YOLO is a popular real-time object detection system that processes images in a single pass. It is known for its speed and accuracy in detecting objects, including vehicles.
    - Implementation: [YOLO vehicle Detection Code](./vehicle__detection_yolo/main.py)
